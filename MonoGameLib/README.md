# MonoGameLib
Adds useful members to monogame that help with creating and managing an actual game.

## Features
### Shapes
- `IShape` allows for uniform implementation and handling of shapes.
- `IPolygon` defines a polygon and simplifies distance and intersection logic across them.

### TextureManager
A central class that streamlines the process of adding sprites to your game.

## Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version specified in `global.json`)
- MonoGame framework

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Collider classes with consistent handling of collisions
- [ ] Graphics manager allowing easy changes of graphics settings at run-time
- [ ] Expansion of TextureManager allowing animated sprites
